# NixOS
NixOS is intended to be a custom o/s I *start* for x86_64bit processors. strong unix roots, parallel processing.
the o/s will be mainly written in assembly not because it's good for o/s's, just cause i like coding in assembly
haha :D i am learning x86_64 assembler now, i used to be a pro at x386 assembler. well, not a pro, but good.
